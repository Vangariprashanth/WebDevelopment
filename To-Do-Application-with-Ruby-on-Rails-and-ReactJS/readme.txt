Project Description:
The To-Do Application is a full-stack web application built using Ruby on Rails for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. 
It allows users to manage their tasks with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. 
Users can create new to-do items, view and update their statuses, and delete items when they are no longer needed. 
The application communicates with the Rails API using Axios for handling asynchronous requests, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. 
This project not only showcases the integration of modern web technologies but also emphasizes best practices in RESTful API development and state management in React.
